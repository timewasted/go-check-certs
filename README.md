go-check-certs
==============

This is a simple utility written in Go to check SSL certificates for a list of hosts. Each certificate in the host's certificate chain is checked for the following:

* Expiration date. By default, you will be warned if a certificate will expire within 30 days. This can be adjusted with `-years=X`, `-months=X`, and/or `-days=X`.
* Signature algorithm. Some algorithms have already been sunset, others are in the process of being sunset. This can be spammy, so you can disable the check with `-check-sig-alg=false`.

Usage looks something like:

```
./go-check-certs -hosts="./path/to/file/with/hosts"
```

The hosts file is simply a single `hostname:port` per line. Empty lines or lines that start with `#` are ignored.

Current limitations:
--------------------

* A certificate must be valid for it to be checked.
