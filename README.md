go-check-certs
==============

This is a simple utility written in Go to check SSL certificates for a list of hosts. Each certificate in the host's certificate chain is checked for the following:

* Expiration date. By default, you will be warned if a certificate will expire within 30 days. This can be adjusted with `-years=X`, `-months=X`, and/or `-days=X`.
* Signature algorithm. Some algorithms have already been sunset, others are in the process of being sunset. This can be spammy, so you can disable the check with `-check-sig-alg=false`.

Usage looks something like:

```
./go-check-certs -hosts="./path/to/file/with/hosts"
```

The hosts file is simply a single `hostname:port` per line. Empty lines or lines that start with `#` are ignored.

Current limitations:
--------------------

* This uses the host's root CA set to check the validity of certificates.  This means that it is not able to validate things like self-signed certificates.
* A certificate must be valid for it to be checked.

Installation
------------

`go-check-certs` is written in Go, so if you have Go installed (you can do so
by following [these instructions](golang.org/doc/install.html)) you can
install it with go get:

```
    go get github.com/timewasted/go-check-certs
```

This will download the code, compile it, and leave an `embedmd` binary
in `$GOPATH/bin`.
